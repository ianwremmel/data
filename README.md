## Install

Even though you'll primarily use this as a build-time dependency, there are
necessary runtime components, so install it as a normal dependency, not a
development dependency.

```bash
npm install @ianwremmel/data
```

## Usage

### Codegen

`@ianwremmel/data` exposes two plugins for
[`graphql-codegen`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen). One plugin produces
a CloudFormation template that defines any of the tables you might need and the
other produces a set of type-definitions and typed functions for interacting
with the generated tables.

First, add the config to your graphql codegen config. There are a bunch of
different ways to use this beyond the scope of these docs, but here's a simple
example.

```yml
generates:
    ./__generated__/actions.ts:
        config:
            enumsAsTypes: true
            scalars:
                Date: Date
                JSONObject: Record<string, unknown>
            strictScalars: true
            dependenciesModuleId: ./dependencies
        plugins:
            - typescript
            - @ianwremmel/data/codegen/actions
    ./__generated__/template.yml:
        config:
            actionsModuleId: ./__generated__/actions
            dependenciesModuleId: ./dependencies
        plugins:
            - @ianwremmel/data/codegen/cloudformation
```

Note the `dependenciesModuleId`. This is any node-resolvable module that exports
the requisite injectable dependencies defined in
[src/runtime/dependencies.ts](src/runtime/dependencies.ts). These dependencies
are primarily AWS v3 clients and observability wrappers. Take a look at the
[example dependencies](examples/dependencies.ts) for more details.

### Runtime

You shouldn't need to use the runtime dependencies directly, but there's a set
of functions that were way easier to import than to try to include in codegen,
so you'll need `@ianwremmel/data` to be available at runtime (or, if you're
using esbuild, build-time _should_ be fine).

#### Error Handling

All Errors thrown or rethrown by this library (except `AssertionError` which is
the default Node `AssertionError`) or generated code are instance of
`BaseDataLibraryError`, which is a subclass of `Error`. Rethrown errors always
have a `cause` property that is the original error.

# Potential Costs

In general, any AWS resources generated by this library will generate costs in
the fractions of cents unless you hit scale. There are, however, a few sets of
resources that will rack of costs faster initially (though, plateau, quickly as
well).

-   Each CDC directive will induce the creation of a KMS key, which costs
    $1/month. This cannot be avoided without disabling encryption entirely
    because there doesn't appear to be any way to grant EventBridge permission
    to use the AWS-managed default key.

## Change Data Capture

Several schema directives (`@enriches` and `@triggers` at time of writing)
generate CloudFormation resources to support change data capture. In general,
this means:

-   The decorated model's table has a DynamoDB Stream enabled
-   Regardless of the number of directives per model or the number of models,
    exactly one lambda listens to the stream
-   That Lambda function pushes each stream event to EventBridge
-   Each directive has a corresponding EventBridge rule that push a filtered
    subset of events into an SQS queue
-   Each SQS queue has a corresponding Lambda that handles the events

Why all the indirection? Filtering, multiple responders, and retries.

There's no Dead Letter Queue for a DynamoDB stream, so we want the stream
handler to be as failsafe as possible. That means it has to do as little as
possible. Ideally, we'd push directly into an SQS queue, but then we only get
one handler per table when we want one handler per directive per Model.

EventBridge lets us 1. attach multiple handlers to the same DynamoDB stream
event and 2. filter events those event so that we only push matching events into
the queue for a given model's directive.

Finally, there's an SQS queue in front of each function so that we can push
failures to its Dead Letter Queue and retry them manually when the underlying
issue is fixed.

## Observability

This library is heavily instrumented with OpenTelemetry and _not_ X-Ray, though
it is assumed you've got X-Ray enabled. For the most part, assuming you have
OpenTelemetry working, you won't need to do anything to receive traces. You
will, however, need to provide `captureException` as an injected dependency. If
you only care about OpenTelemetry, you can simply use `captureException`
directly from @code-like-a-carpenter/telemetry:

```ts
export {captureException} from '@code-like-a-carpenter/telemetry';
```

If, however, you'd also like to send exceptions to somewhere like Sentry, you'll
need to wrap `captureException`:

```ts
import {captureException as clcCaptureException} from '@code-like-a-carpenter/telemetry';

export const captureException = (error: unknown, escaped = true) => {
    clcCaptureException(error);
    Sentry.captureException(error);
};
```

### Alarms

This library no longer generates CloudWatch alarms. Instead, you'll want to
post-process the output template to generate alarms that work well with your
alerts.

You'll want to generate at least the following alarms:

-   EventBridge invocation failures for every `AWS::Events::Rule`
-   Messages in a Dead Letter Queue for every `AWS::SQS::Queue` with "DLQ" in
    the name
-   SQS Queue Age for any queue that's not a Dead Letter Queue
-   SQS Queue Size for any queue that's not a Dead Letter Queue
-   Lambda invocation errors
-   Lambda memory usage
-   Lambda duration
-   Lambda coldstart duration
-   Lambda Max Iterator Age for DynamoDB Stream listeners (i.e., any Lambda that
    starts with "TableDispatcher"

> Note that coldstart duration and memory usage require the LambdaInsights Layer
> to be enabled, which can get quite expensive if you have invocations.

Here's an example of how you might create an alarm for a Dead Letter Queue that
triggers any time there are messages in the queue.

```ts
const tpl = yml.load(readFileSync(fullInputPath, 'utf8'), {
    schema: CLOUDFORMATION_SCHEMA,
}) as ServerlessApplicationModel;

import yml from 'js-yaml';
import {CLOUDFORMATION_SCHEMA} from 'js-yaml-cloudformation-schema';

Object.entries(tpl.Resources)
    .filter(([, resource]) => resource.Type === 'AWS::SQS::Queue')
    .filter(
        ([name]) => name.includes('DeadLetterQueue') || name.includes('DLQ')
    )
    .forEach(([name]) => {
        Object.assign(tpl.Resources, makeDLQAlarm(name));
    });

export function makeDLQAlarm(queueName: string) {
    return {
        [`${queueName}ThresholdAlarm`]: {
            Properties: {
                ActionsEnabled: true,
                AlarmActions: [{Ref: 'PagerdutyAlarmTopic'}],
                AlarmDescription: {
                    'Fn::Sub': [
                        // eslint-disable-next-line no-template-curly-in-string
                        'Dead Letter present in ${DeadLetterQueueName}',
                        {
                            DeadLetterQueueName: {
                                'Fn::GetAtt': `${queueName}.QueueName`,
                            },
                        },
                    ],
                },
                AlarmName: {
                    'Fn::Sub': [
                        // eslint-disable-next-line no-template-curly-in-string
                        '/aws/sqs/sum-dead-letter/${DeadLetterQueueName}',
                        {
                            DeadLetterQueueName: {
                                'Fn::GetAtt': `${queueName}.QueueName`,
                            },
                        },
                    ],
                },

                    },
                ],

            },

    };
}
```

## Known Issues

-   There's a branch where I've started working on OpenSearch support, but
    thanks to the localstack issues described above and the time it takes to
    deploy an actual OpenSearch cluster, there's no practical way to test it.

## Contribute

PRs welcome, but please open an issue to discuss anything but the smallest
changes first to make sure the change is in line with the project goals.

### Testing

There are two ways to run the example tests: directly in AWS or locally with
localstack. You can use `./script/deploy-examples-to-aws` or
`./script/deploy-examples-to-localstack` to deploy to the respective
environment. Once deployed, use `TEST_MODE=aws|localstack npm test` to run the
tests.

When testing against AWS, you'll either need to load credentials into your
environment (e.g. `TEST_MODE=aws aws-vault exec playground -- npm test`) or
configure a profile in `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` which will be
loaded automatically. By default, the profile name is `webstorm_playground`, but
you can override this by setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable.

Setting up a profile will make things easier if you want to run tests from
within your IDE.
